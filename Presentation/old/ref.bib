  abstract = {In this paper we present a simple database definition language:
              that of categories and functors. A database schema is a small
              category and an instance is a set-valued functor on it. We show
              that morphisms of schemas induce three “data migration functors”,
              which translate instances from one schema to the other in canonical
              ways. These functors parameterize projections, unions, and joins
              over all tables simultaneously and can be used in place of
              conjunctive and disjunctive queries. We also show how to connect a
              database and a functional programming language by introducing a
              functorial connection between the schema and the category of types
              for that language. We begin the paper with a multitude of examples
              to motivate the definitions, and near the end we provide a
              dictionary whereby one can translate database concepts into
              category-theoretic concepts and vice versa.},
