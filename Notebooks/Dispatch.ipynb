    "# **On Dispatching Design Patters**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have experience with Object Oriented Programming languages such as Python, you might\n",
    "find strange the way packages are implemented in Julia. For example, Julia does not have classes!\n",
    "Hence, you might wonder how you should design your code, since you probably won't be creating\n",
    "classes with methods, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple-dispatch capability of Julia makes design patterns in Julia quite different. First of all,\n",
    "in Julia, instead, of classes we only have structs.\n",
    "The struct can be thought of as composite \"types\", on which\n",
    "functions can be written in order to transform such struct. Besides structs, we have abstract types,\n",
    "which provide a hierarchy to the many types in Julia, and help to properly dispatch function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a struct is not like a class where one defines methods,\n",
    "but it's more like a \"concrete\" type to which functions are applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics on Structs and Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, while in OOP a class will generate objects that have \"methods\" inside of it.\n",
    "In Julia, there are no methods, it's all functions.\n",
    "These functions are separated from the structs, and\n",
    "the way we tie them together is via multiple dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might make things clearer. At first, let's create a struct to store 2D coordinate points.\n"

    "### Extending the Dispatch Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple dispatch functionality in Julia is not only beautiful, but also powerful. Yet, it only\n",
    "works for variables of different types. It would be nice if we could use the dispatch in other situations, such\n",
    "as depending on wheter a value is larger than 0, or if the user provided an specific keyword.\n",
    "Of course, we can always write many \"if\" and \"else\" statements to deal with it.\n",
    "But the dispatch is so nice and tidy, that it makes us want to use it more broadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is not possible \"natively\" in Julia. But thanks to Julia's metaprogramming capabilities,\n",
    "there are some packages that extend the dispatching. Let's take a look at two packages specifically,\n",
    "the `WhereTraits.jl` and the `KeywordDispatch.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's use the `WhereTraits.jl` to create new functions to price `Board` types."
